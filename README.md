# Drupal Custom Modules Examples


You can download, modify and share this software as in the [four freedoms of Free Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software#Free_software). 
Please, don't use these modules in projects and of course not in production (live) environments
They are only for training purposes, testing or workshops. They are not finished, they don't have built-in tests and for sure, they won't be the most optimal solution to address a problem. 
So please, only use the modules for training and playing with Drupal.  

**This repository contains a collection of custom modules designed for various applications.**
